# Logical & Statistical Thinking with Coding Practice

Welcome to the **Logical & Statistical Thinking with Coding Practice** repository! This is a collection of exercises designed to improve your logical reasoning, statistical understanding, and coding abilities. Whether you're a beginner looking to enhance your problem-solving skills or an experienced coder preparing for technical interviews, this repository provides a variety of challenges to help you grow.

## Contents

This repository contains a series of problems and challenges categorized into the following themes:

- **Logical Thinking**: Sharpen your reasoning abilities by solving puzzles and problems that require critical thinking and algorithmic strategies.
- **Statistical Thinking**: Improve your understanding of statistical concepts, such as probability, distributions, hypothesis testing, and data analysis.
- **Coding Practice**: Each problem is designed to be solved through programming, allowing you to practice and improve your coding skills across various languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.).

## Problem Structure

Each problem in this repository follows a clear structure:

1. **Problem Statement**: A detailed description of the problem to be solved, including any relevant assumptions.
2. **Input/Output Format**: Clearly defined input and output formats to ensure consistency in problem-solving.
3. **Example Test Cases**: Example input and expected output for better clarity.
4. **Solution Guidelines**: Some problems may include hints or guidelines to steer you in the right direction, though they are generally self-contained and meant to challenge your understanding.
